# ranked-ttt-gmod

TTT kill tracking system. Not really sure what its supposed to accomplish. Tracks kills players make with various weapons and stores them in a weird local database thing. sv_playerinfo.lua is a modified evolve welcome message thing that also says what a players best/most used weapon is. sh_weaponinfo.lua adds the !stats command to evolve, which allows a player to see how many kills they've made with the different types of weapons.
